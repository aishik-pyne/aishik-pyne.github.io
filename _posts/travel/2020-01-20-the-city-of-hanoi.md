In January of 2020, I decided to travel to Vietnam and visit breathtaking landscapes and try out the local Vietnamese food.

I traveled across the country visiting Northern and the Southern part of Vietnam. I visited the city of Hanoi and from where I hopped around to places like Ninh Binh and Ha Long Bay. During the second half of my trip, I flew to Saigon also known as Ho Chi Minh city, and got a chance to visit Muine too!

## Reaching Hanoi from India

My home town is Kolkata and Indigo had quite recently started direct flights to Hanoi around Nov 2019 at a moderate fare. It took about ₹8k ($110) but prices may fluctuate in the future. The flight is about 2 hours and with an adjusted 2 hours time difference. My flight takes off at I.S.T 1 pm and lands in Hanoi at I.C.T 5 pm (Vietnam Local Time).

The first thing you notice on arrival is that Vietnam is not a very English friendly country. It is advisable to take a local sim and keep an offline translator app handy. A temporary sim card can set you back ₹850 ($11) and it's worth getting.

We were picked up by our guide who dropped us to our hotel. On the way, we crossed the Red River using the [Nhật Tân][Nhật Tân] bridge as rained poured heavily. The Nhật Tân was open in 2015 and made crossing the river faster and easier. At night the Nhật Tân lights up with a range of colors making it a piece of art.

## Food, Currency and Downtown Hanoi

It was on us to roam the city and find dinner for ourselves. The most popular part of the city is the Old District. However, we were surprised to see the most happening part of the city closes off most of it's shop by 9:30 pm. This made us scavenging the streets for any open restaurant till we found Runam Bistro.

3 major surprises I got on my first day. One of them was a delightful bowl of Pho.

The other one being the Vietnamese currency Dong and Uber does not work there. However the alternative is the [Grab App][Grab App]
At my time it was approx 300 Dongs for ₹1.
We grabbed a cab back to our hotel. The hotel a picturesque view of the down town and overlooking the Red River.

## The City of Hanoi

The Lunar New Year was around the corner on the 25th of Jan. The is a huge migration activity during this as all workers return to their hometown leaving the city deserted. Preparations for this occasion is grand. Each family is said to have either a **peach tree** with pink blossoms or a **kumquat tree** or commonly known as small oranges. These are said to bring prosperity to the family.
