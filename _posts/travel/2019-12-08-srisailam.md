## Route

If you are going from Hyderabad, you'll highly be taking a car or a bike. However if you take a bike, and check google maps, it will redirect you to another route taking a huge diversion. This is not nessessary, you can simply take the car route and bikes are allowed though the Nallamala jungle. Make sure that you travel during the sun is up, as there not street lights up in mountains.
