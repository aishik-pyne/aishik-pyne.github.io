# Web Development Course (Journal)

### Two broad classifications:

![Front_vs_BackEnd](https://davidmles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/frontend-vs-backend-768x432.png)

1. **Frontend** - Manages the looks and design of the website. Everytime a user(client) requests a webpage a copy of the Frontend matter is send to the clients browser and the browser displays it.
2. **Backend** - This code lies is a server hosted by admin. This can contain sensetive data like username and passwords and also website data. When a request is made and language like **PHP** which runs in the background parses the requests and generates a Frontend matter which is sent to the client.

 The overall process can be managed for blog websites by a **CMS** (Content Management System) e.g. Wordpress , which requires almost no coding experience. It's a GUI based platform which is hosted in a server.

However the functionality of this kind of system is quite restricted and only uselful to handle _static blogs_.  
Hence to have more control over the backend we use languages and services like **PHP, MySQL, Django** etc.
